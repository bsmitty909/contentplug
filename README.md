Twill — The Content Plug

A multi-stream viewer with drag-and-drop slots, queueing, embedded chat, resizable layout, and built-in screen recording.


Overview

Twill is a web-based tool that allows you to load, arrange, and watch multiple live or VOD streams from YouTube and Kick simultaneously.
You can queue videos, drag them into four customizable player slots (A–D), resize columns/rows, toggle chat, choose an audio-focus slot, and even record your screen directly from the interface.

It is entirely client-side — no backend required.
